Understand the importance of data integrity and standardized data formats.\n","\n","* **Visualization**: Explore various methods and tools for effectively visualizing data to reveal trends, patterns, and outliers. Discuss the principles of good data visualization and how to choose the right type of chart for different types of data.\n","\n","* **Practical Example**: Apply the concepts in a hands-on project that involves data handling and visualization to derive actionable insights. This will include a case study to demonstrate the real-world application of the tools and techniques discussed.\n","\n","\n","<img src=\"https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"315\" alt=\"Description of the image\">\n","\n","**<ins>Material generated by:</ins>**\n","- Martina Cádiz Leyton\n","- Daniel Moreno Cartagena<br>\n","\n","*Date: 06-10-2024*\n","\n","---\n","---\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"73212a1d","metadata":{"id":"73212a1d"},"source":["This workshop will begin with a brief introduction to useful libraries for data management and visualization. The objective is to provide knowledge about the existence of these tools that you could use in future projects.\n","\n","\n","<ins>**Libraries for Data Management**</ins>\n","\n","* **Pandas**: Ideal for structured data operations and manipulations. It is well-suited for different kinds of data, such as: tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, ordered and unordered time series data, arbitrary matrix data with row and column labels, and any other form of observational or statistical data sets.\n","\n","* **Polars**: A fast multi-threaded DataFrame library that is optimized for performance and efficient memory use. Perfect for larger-than-memory datasets.\n","\n","* **Spark**: Excellent for big data processing. Allows for data processing in batches or in real time, making it highly suitable for handling large-scale data across a cluster.\n","\n","<ins>**Libraries for Visualization**</ins>\n","\n","* **Matplotlib**: A robust library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Perfect for those who need fine control over their plots.\n","\n","* **Plotly**: Provides interactive plots and is accessible via a web browser; ideal for creating dashboards with dynamic visualizations.\n","\n","* **Bokeh**: Great for creating interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications on modern web-browsers. It empowers the user to generate elegant and concise graphics akin to those of D3.js."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"38a63495","metadata":{"id":"38a63495"},"source":["# Data Managment"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"15660d9d","metadata":{"id":"15660d9d"},"source":["## Pandas"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"f4918786","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"f4918786","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717950641737,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":7077,"user":{"displayName":"Martina Alicia Cádiz Leyton","userId":"08774618317242651430"}},"outputId":"a2232854-a1ca-46fe-8af5-66987e232876"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Requirement already satisfied: pandas in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (2.0.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: python-dateutil>=2.8.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from pandas) (2.8.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pytz>=2020.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from pandas) (2023.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: tzdata>=2022.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from pandas) (2024.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.21.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from pandas) (1.25.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: six>=1.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from python-dateutil>=2.8.2->pandas) (1.16.0)\n"]}],"source":["!pip install pandas"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"30d0b6d0","metadata":{"id":"30d0b6d0"},"source":["### 1.
