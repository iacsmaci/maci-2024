        "# Challenge: Assigning a Churn Risk Score to Enhance Customer Retention\n",
        "\n",
        "<ins>**Overview:**</ins>\n",
        "\n",
        "In today’s rapidly evolving digital service market, customer retention is more critical than ever. Businesses face the challenge of high churn rates, which can significantly impede sustainability and growth. This project harnesses the power of machine learning to analyze customer behaviors and interactions, aiming to predict and mitigate potential churn by assigning a churn risk score to each customer. This score serves as a strategic tool for implementing targeted retention strategies, ultimately enhancing customer loyalty and reducing turnover.\n",
        "\n",
        "<ins>**Problem Statement:**</ins>\n",
        "\n",
        "The main objective of this challenge is to develop a predictive model capable of calculating a churn risk score from 1 to 5 for each customer, based on their interaction and transaction data. This score will help identify customers who are at risk of ending their services, allowing the business to proactively engage with them through tailored retention efforts. By understanding the patterns that lead to customer churn, companies can take actionable steps to retain their most vulnerable customers and thereby improve their overall retention rates.\n",
